## SubtitleDownloader
A simple python script to download subtitle. Just run the script on a folder, and it will download all the srt files for you.
Unfortunately, thesubdb.com's collection is not that great. I'll try to add more source in the next iteration!

## How to run:
just link it to your bin folder (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6967331/how-do-i-install-a-script-to-run-anywhere-from-the-command-line)
